## About

A collection of Automator workflows for macOS. See each folder for workflows, install instructions, and manual setup steps if you'd like to recreate the projects in Automator.

## Workflows

### Add AlertTones to Sound Library
Copies the audio files (all files with .caf extension) from `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AlertTones/` to `~/Library/Sounds`, then reformats their names for easier legibility when selecting sounds in *System Preferences > Sounds*.

### Count Characters
Counts characters for selected text in Notes, and displays the results as a Notification Center notification.

### Scale Images to 50%
Duplicates image files selected in the Finder, resizes those copies' dimensions to 50%, and renames them to end in "-half" for differentiation.

### Show Unix File Permissions
Reads the Unix file permissions of selected Finder files and folders, and displays them in a dialog box.
